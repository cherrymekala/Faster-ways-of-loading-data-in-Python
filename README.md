# Faster Ways of Loading Data in Python

This project explores some of the fastest ways to access data from CSV, Excel, or Pickle files using Python. The goal is to enhance data processing efficiency by leveraging various techniques and tools available in Python.

## Project Features

1. **Smarter Utilization of Pandas for Excel Data**:
   - Efficient techniques to read and manipulate Excel files using Pandas.
   - Methods to optimize data loading speed and memory usage.

2. **Parallel Processing Using `joblib`**:
   - Harness the power of parallel computing to speed up data processing tasks.
   - Examples of using `joblib` to parallelize operations across multiple CPU cores.

3. **Utilizing Pickle Files**:
   - Save and load Python objects quickly with Pickle for faster data access.
   - Demonstrations of using Pickle for efficient serialization and deserialization.

4. **Parallel Processing with Excel Files**:
   - Techniques for reading multiple Excel files concurrently using parallel processing.
   - Detailed examples of improving Excel data handling with `joblib`.
